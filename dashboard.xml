        <code>19CSE305</code>
        <description>It is another advanced-level ML project where you have to deal mostly with audio data.
            Speech emotion recognition attempts to identify and interpret user emotions and deduce the emotional state from speech. 
            To train such an algorithm, you have to use most of the training data as audio data. This system will take user speech as input.</description>

        <description>Mining text is one of the popular computation techniques widely applied in applications like text summarization, topic classification, machine translation, 
            sentiment analysis, etc. Modern cybersecurity systems are utilizing machine learning methods a lot.
             Spam filtering also leverages text mining and document classification to segregate legitimate mails and spam emails.</description>

        <description>Have you ever seen movies or web series on online streaming platforms? Once you watch one or two of them, 
            you will notice that apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime recommend new web series and movies. 
            It is because these apps render machine learning models that try to understand the customer's taste.  
            All modern apps come with a recommendation engine that suggests users for more engagement.  </description>
